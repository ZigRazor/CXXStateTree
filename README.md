## 🚀 Features

* 🔧 Fluent builder API with lambda-based DSL
* ⚡ Fast runtime performance with zero heap allocation
* 🛡️ Optional guards and actions for transitions
* 🔄 Event-based state transitions
* 🧪 Google Test integration
* 📈 Code coverage with Codecov
* 🌳 Designed for extensibility: nested states, DOT export coming soon
* 🔧 Deployed as Shared Library and as Single Header-Only library

## 🛠️ Quick Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "CXXStateTree/StateTree.hpp"

using namespace CXXStateTree;

int main() {
    auto machine = StateTree::Builder()
        .initial("Idle")
        .state("Idle", [](State& s) {
            s.on("Start", "Running", nullptr, []() {
                std::cout << "Idle -> Running" << std::endl;
            });
        })
        .state("Running", [](State& s) {
            s.on("Stop", "Idle", nullptr, []() {
                std::cout << "Running -> Idle" << std::endl;
            });
        })
        .build();

    machine.send("Start");
    machine.send("Stop");
}
```

## 🛠️ Building Shared Library

```bash
cmake -S . -B build 
cmake --build build
```

After these command the Shared Library can be found in `build` directory

Please Note: in future release cmake will have the ability to install the library automatically, for now it is necessary to do it manually

---

## 🛠️ Building Single Header-Only Library

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_SINGLE_HEADER=ON
cmake --build build
```

After these command the Single Header-Only Library can be found in `single_include` directory with the name CXXStateTree.hpp

Please Note: in future release cmake will have the ability to install the library automatically, for now it is necessary to do it manually

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_TEST=ON -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON
cmake --build build
cd build && ctest
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

* C++20 compiler (GCC >= 10, Clang >= 11, MSVC >= 2019)
* [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) (auto-downloaded via CMake)
